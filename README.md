Python code to solve the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm

This code was implemented for a project under Advanced Algorithms Course(UE20CS311),PES UNIVERSITY.

This project accepts an input of 81 characters long string of numbers from 0 to 9, where 0 represents an empty cell on the Sudoku Board. The input is taken from a sudoku problem. The algorithm's goal is to swap out all the zeros for appropriate numbers so that the full Sudoku puzzle can be solved. In order to do this task conventionally, the processor must, in the worst case, test every one of the 2*10^77 potential combinations. Therefore, one of the finest solutions to this problem is the **Backtracking Algorithm**, which may solve it in a comparably shorter amount of time.

The code can be checked for various inputs by modifying the puzzles.py file and can be verified using the answers.py file.
